Ongoing development to organize my projects while learning Rust.

## Future Work
* This app currently uses SQL to read/write data but will be refactored to use JSON. 
* It also uses a vim-like keybinding "y" for "yank" and "p" for "paste" which allows the user to reorder projects, however in the future this yank/paste ability will be used more intelligently to recategorize data by whatever box it was pasted into, e.g., a project pasted into the Task box becomes a task and its original tasks become subtasks, while a task pasted into Project box becomes a project with its subtasks the original tasks.
